About the project:

UasiBookTranslator is a Java application used to translate books and various other large text files from English to Uasi. The primary goal is to translate with 100% accuracy from English to Uasi.

Uasi is an artificial language created by the Hershy bros. Its purpose is mainly composed of having an encrypted means of communicating to one another while also having fun learning an unusual language. 

If you are not familiar with Uasi, please refer to the official website: http://uasilanguage.online

Uasi's rules are not very complex, but there are still certain principles that must be followed in order to translate accurately from English to Uasi, or vice versa. The Guide is the definitive book for learning the rules of the language.

What makes automating the translation process from English to Uasi difficult is the wide array of irregularities and inconsistencies of the English language. Thanks to Stanford's Log-linear Part-Of-Speech Tagger the task went from impossible to conceivable. 

Please refer to these links to become acquainted with Stanford's POS application:

I'm looking for help and contributions from other Java developers to increase the precision of this translator. If you think this would be a fun project, please get involved! :)

How to get started:

If you are using IntelliJ IDE, simply clone the repository to your local machine, open an existing project in IntelliJ, and point it to the location of the root folder you just cloned. Everything should work without any other configurations.

If you are not using IntelliJ, after you clone the repo, you may need to import the stanford-postagger.jar file into your IDE. Each IDE will differ, but to give you an idea, this is what I had to do in IntelliJ:
